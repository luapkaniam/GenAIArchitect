      "1.  **Course ID:** C009\n",
      "    **Course Title:** Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes\n",
      "    **Relevance:** Highly relevant. This course directly addresses the core technologies (Docker and Kubernetes) for containerizing and orchestrating microservices. It covers essential Kubernetes concepts like pods, deployments, services, and ingress, along with cluster provisioning, autoscaling, and Helm chart packaging, all crucial for microservices deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Course ID:** C010\n",
      "    **Course Title:** APIs and Microservices Architecture\n",
      "    **Relevance:** Highly relevant. This course focuses on designing and implementing APIs and microservices architectures. It covers microservices patterns, containerized deployment, versioning strategies, and security best practices, providing a comprehensive understanding of building interconnected services.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Course ID:** C008\n",
      "    **Course Title:** DevOps Practices and CI/CD\n",
      "    **Relevance:** Very Relevant. While not directly focused on Kubernetes, this course is essential for deploying and managing microservices effectively. It covers CI/CD pipelines, container registry integration, and monitoring tools, all necessary for a robust microservices deployment strategy.\n",
